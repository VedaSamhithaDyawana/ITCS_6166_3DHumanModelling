# 2.Introduction:
## 3D Human Modeling:
A physical body is represented by three-dimensional (3D) models using a network of points connected by various geometrical objects like triangles, lines, curved surfaces, etc. The process of creating three-dimensional representations of an object or surface is known as three-dimensional modeling. A detailed and accurate 3D model of a human body is what is intended by 3D human modeling. This model can then be used for a variety of applications, including animation, video games, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
The proposed model is deployed into a AWS, GCP or any other cloud service. Video data is transmitted and processed using WebRTC protocols.


# 3.‘Client Server Application’ in 3D Human Modelling.
We will be using Client server architecture in this project. The backend part will be implemented using python/flask. We will be using WebRTC as the underlying communication between client and server.
# 4. Project plan based on two weeks iteration 
Iteration 1: 
•	Planned to conduct a meeting with team to review and understand project scope, objectives, and timeline. 
•	Research and gather the necessary requirements. And also, will do the background study about the topic.
•	Create a basic client server functionality and conduct initial testing.
•	Create a WebRTC environment using the resources provided.
•	Initial testing of the web app connected via WebRTC.
Iteration 2:
•	Make necessary changes to the algorithm after initial testing.
•	Integrate audio and video transmission functionality using WebRTC.
•	Implement video transmission into web browser
Iteration 3:
•	Conduct code reviews and address the bugs found during testing.
•	Improve performance, scalability of the algorithm.
Iteration 4:
•	Evaluates the results and complete documentation for the project.
•	Presentation on the final project.
•	Upload the final report as well as the code onto canvas.
