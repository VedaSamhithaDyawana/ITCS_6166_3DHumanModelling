# 2.Introduction:
## 3D Human Modeling:
A physical body is represented by three-dimensional (3D) models using a network of points connected by various geometrical objects like triangles, lines, curved surfaces, etc.
The process of creating three-dimensional representations of an object or surface is known as three-dimensional modeling.
A detailed and accurate 3D model of a human body is what is intended by 3D human modeling. This model can then be used for a variety of applications, including animation, video games, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
## Hand pose Sign Language:
Hand gestures are an essential component of communication and a great way to ensure that we are conveying our message and supporting what we are trying to say.
### Text to Voice:
For people with hearing impairments to easily communicate with sighted people, TTS offers a solution that will not only automatically recognize hand gestures but will also translate them into speech from the text output. The hand gestures of the person are recognized using contour feature extraction, which is done using a camera attached to a computer. The recorded soundtrack will be played based on the recognized gestures.
### Voice to Text:
Blind people can communicate with others thanks to hand gesture recognition technology, which recognizes and captures their voice and outputs it in text format. To understand the communication, voice recordings are used in conjunction with webcams to track hand movements. The images are then resized with the aid of pre-processing. Making a system that can convert speech and hand gestures into text is the aim of this study. To aid in identification, hand gestures are analyzed. Deaf people and hearing people can communicate more effectively thanks to the technology's text output.

# 4. Project plan based on two weeks iteration 
Week 1 :
Day 1 : Planned to conduct a meeting with team to review and understand project scope, objectives, and timeline.
Day 2-3 : Will do research and gather the necessary requirements. And also, will do the background study.
Day 4-5 : Will create a detailed task list and assign it to team members.
Day 6-7 : Planned to develop the high-level design and architecture and analysis of methodology.

Week 2:
Day 8-9 : Will start coding and development work. Modelling of problems
Day 10-11 : Conduct the code reviews and will test the code together with team in order to check each and every functionality.
Day 12-13 : Will address any bugs or issues found during the testing and will fix those issues. Evaluation of results.
Day 14 : Final review and documentation.
